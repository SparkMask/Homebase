## Our Story:

SparkMask originally was founded as Blumemail, now a subsidiary of SparkMask.
The founder of SparkMask always wanted to have a business, since they were a kid. Once he got older, he was thinking "what could be my first business?" after a few months of thinking he said... Maybe an email service is right!!! So Blumemail was being worked on in September of 2024. And it's release date was in November. Now in January of 2025, Blumemail was planning to expand to more services and offerings which is why SparkMask was created. 

Our new vision: More services & offerings that support privacy and security, which matters.
A New work enviorment.
And More!
